- 👋 Hi, I’m Datura, a Belgian TransFem/Enby salty bitch.
- 👀 I’m interested in geeky, nerdy and generally sciency stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to first and foremost become a *somewhat* decent programmer… Once I'm not **entirely** useless, I'll probably try to contribute to projects I like.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can't. Please don't try to email me, I like my peace and quiet. I'll only reply to issues and pull requests.
